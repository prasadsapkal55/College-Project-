# ShareHub - File Sharing App 

The file transfer application developed using Tkinter provides a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving files over a network. Through the integration of socket communication, SQLite databases, and graphical user interface elements, the application offers a seamless experience for users to exchange files securely.

The project successfully achieves its objectives by allowing users to select files for transmission, initiate the sending or receiving process, and store relevant file details in SQLite databases for future reference. Additionally, the implementation of a dark mode feature enhances the user experience by offering visual customization options.
